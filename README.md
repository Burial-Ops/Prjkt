# 📚 CourseInsight – Smarter Course Choices for Every Student

Welcome to CourseInsight, your all-in-one academic decision-making platform designed to help students make informed choices about courses and electives — tailored to their specific branch and interests.


### **Problem Statement:**

University students often struggle to choose the right courses and electives due to a lack of reliable, student-driven information. There's no centralized platform that provides branch-specific course details, honest reviews, difficulty levels, or peer ratings. This leads to confusion, misaligned expectations, and poor academic decisions — especially for freshers.

CourseInsight aims to solve this by offering a transparent, student-powered platform where users can explore courses, view real ratings, and share feedback — making course selection smarter and more informed.

&nbsp;

Choosing the right course shouldn't be a guessing game. With CourseInsight, students can:

* Explore detailed course information.

* Read real student feedback.

* View average difficulty ratings.

* Discover highly-rated professors and facilities.

* Share their own experiences.


We aim to bring transparency and confidence to course selection — especially for freshers navigating academic life for the first time.
